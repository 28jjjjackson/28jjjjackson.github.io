        <h1>Information on Adding Flash Games</h1>
        <p>1. Visit <a href="https://archive.org/download/zor_flashgames_collection">this dump</a> on archive.org. Go into one of the folders (named F1, F2, F3, etc) and find a game. Be sure to also look around on the rest of the Internet Archive as well as searching on Google, as there are many pages full of downloadable Flash games. Essentially, it doesn't matter where you get them from, so long as you are able to download a .SWF file.</p>
        <p>2. Right click on the game and click "Save Link As".</p>
        <p>3. Visit <a href="https://github.dev/JaxTraxx/JaxTraxx.github.io">the code editor</a>.</p>
        <p>4. Open the Files app, navigate to Google Drive, and drag the downloaded SWF file onto the "Explorer" pane on the left (the one with all of the files).</p>
        <p>5. Right click any of the game HTML files (for example, btd3.html) and click "Copy".</p>
        <p>6. Scroll down to the bottom of the Explorer pane. In the small amount of blank space below the lowest file, right click and click "Paste".</p>
        <p>7. Right click the newly created file and click "Rename". Rename it to the name of the game.</p>
        <p>8. Open the file you just renamed. Follow the instructions in the following image.</p>

        <p>10. Change the "href" from "run.html" (or whatever it was before) to the name of the HTML file you created. (Not the name of the SWF, but the HTML file that you edited.)</p>
        <p>11. Change the name (in this case, run, and this is what is between the two A tags) to whatever you want, but it should be the name of the game.</p>
        <p>12. Follow the instructions in the following image.</p>

        <p>13. You are done! Note that it may take a minute or two for your changes to show up on the website, so be patient.</p>
